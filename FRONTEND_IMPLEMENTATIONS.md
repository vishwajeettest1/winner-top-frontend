## Requirement implementation status

This document distinguishes between frontend behavior present in the project and production behavior that requires backend, payment-gateway, or verified company data.

### Frontend implementation

| ID | Requirement | Status | Current implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Registration, OTP, full video completion, and referral importance | ⚠️ Frontend implemented | Registration collects mobile/email and verifies OTP. Watch UI gates reward credit on full completion and highlights referrals. Production video catalog and reward enforcement remain backend responsibilities. |
| R2 | Fixed amount to start earning | ⚠️ Payment flow prepared | Dashboard and Wallet route users to the Wallet payment flow. Starter activation is considered active only from backend-confirmed wallet data; local storage cannot activate it. |
| R3 | Wallet balance and immediate reward reflection | ⚠️ Frontend integrated | Dashboard and Wallet read API wallet data and refresh after reward events. Durable ledger persistence and authoritative balances require the backend. |
| R4 | Referral links and friend referrals | ⚠️ Frontend implemented | Invite page provides referral link, code, copy, native share, stats, and status UI. Secure link validation and referral attribution require the backend. |
| R5 | Referral earning status | ⚠️ Frontend implemented | Active, pending, and paid status presentation is available. Commission calculation and payout automation remain backend-dependent. |
| R6 | Ten daily videos and immediate credit | ⚠️ Frontend implemented | Daily cap, progress, watched state, full-watch reward request, and duplicate-submit protection are implemented. Server-side cap and reward idempotency remain required. |
| R7 | Seven-day withdrawal period and countdown | ⚠️ Frontend implemented | Withdrawal form, live countdown, expected date, guide, and request history are available. The backend must provide authoritative request/deadline data and process payouts. |
| R8 | Help Center, FAQs, and support | ✅ Frontend implemented | Help Center includes animated FAQ accordion, call/email actions, process information, and an About link. Support ticket processing is not connected. |
| R9 | About Us | ⚠️ UI implemented; company data temporary | Mission, vision, services, story, team cards, achievements, support contacts, and social links are displayed. Replace temporary names, statistics, contacts, and social destinations with verified company data. |
| R10 | Add money via UPI or bank account | ⚠️ Frontend payment-ready | Wallet includes amount entry, UPI/bank selection, payment-order request, status messaging, and secure-credit notice. Real gateway checkout, signature/webhook verification, and wallet credit require the backend. |

### Backend and production gaps

- Real payment processing and starter-plan activation
- Server-side wallet ledger and balance persistence
- Server-side video catalog with 10–12 managed videos
- Server-side full-watch validation, daily cap, and idempotent reward credit
- Referral attribution, commission calculation, and payout status automation
- Withdrawal deadline authority and payout processing
- Customer support ticketing or CRM integration
- Verified About Us founder/team data, photos, social profile URLs, and achievement statistics

### Recent frontend safeguards

- Local starter activation no longer changes wallet balance or status.
- Duplicate reward requests are blocked while a completion request is in flight.
- Withdrawal countdown recalculates every second.
- Direct OTP access without registration context redirects to registration.
- Admin routes require a separate admin token and admin API requests use that token.
- The shared login page checks the separate admin authentication endpoint first, routes administrators to the admin workspace, and stores admin and user tokens separately.
- The admin workspace includes overview metrics, searchable user access management, pending withdrawal review, video-file upload UI, ad placements, and sponsored campaign management.
- Watch completion state persists for the current local day and is visibly marked as Watched.
- Wallet and Withdrawal amount controls keep their number spinners visible and use inline validation instead of browser popups.
- Home, Wallet, Watch, Invite, Withdraw, Help, About, Login, and Sign Up share consistent motion, hover, and focus treatment.

### Main frontend routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/login` | Shared sign-in; administrator accounts open the admin workspace |
| `/register` | New account creation with mobile, email, password, and optional referral code |
| `/verify-otp` | Registration OTP verification |
| `/` | Dashboard, balance summary, starter-plan entry point, and account shortcuts |
| `/watch` | Daily videos, full-watch progress, reward completion, and watched state |
| `/wallet` | Balance, Add Money via UPI/bank, starter status, and transaction summaries |
| `/referrals` | Referral link, native share, invite stats, and referral statuses |
| `/withdrawals` | $50 minimum withdrawal request, seven-day countdown, guide, and history |
| `/help` | Support contacts and FAQ accordion |
| `/about` | Mission, vision, product story, team, achievements, contacts, and social links |
| `/admin` | Admin overview with user, content, withdrawal, and ledger metrics |
| `/admin/users` | Search accounts and block or restore access |
| `/admin/withdrawals` | Review pending payout requests |
| `/admin/content` | Upload videos and manage placements and sponsored campaigns |

### Payment API contract

The Wallet frontend sends `POST /payments/create-order` with `{ amount, method }`, where `method` is `upi` or `bank`. The backend should return `checkoutUrl` or `paymentUrl`, verify the gateway signature/webhook server-side, and update the wallet only after confirmed payment.

### Overall verdict

The project is a polished frontend prototype with the main client journeys implemented. It is not yet a production-backed rewards or payments platform until the backend and payment gateway responsibilities above are completed.
